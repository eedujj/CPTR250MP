                        The Bacarra Bell Tower is an integral part of the St. Andrew the Apostle Church, built in the early 17th century during the Spanish colonial era. It stands as an exemplary representation of earthquake baroque architecture, featuring sturdy coral stone and brick construction with a blend of Spanish and Ilocano influences. The tower's primary function was to house church bells, which served to call people to worship and signal important events. It has a distinctive quadrilateral design with ornate details and openings for bells on its upper levels. These bells had various tones and played a vital role in the community, announcing Mass times and events. The tower is a protected historical site, subject to conservation efforts to maintain its historical value. It's a popular tourist attraction known for its unique architectural style and is closely associated with the annual Bac-Bacarra Festival, celebrating the town's cultural heritage.

                        The Bacarra Church, also known as the St. Andrew the Apostle Parish Church, is a historically significant and architecturally impressive religious structure in Bacarra, Ilocos Norte, Philippines. Built in 1593 during the Spanish colonial period, it is one of the country's oldest churches and is a fine example of Baroque architecture, characterized by its ornate and sturdy design. The church is made of locally quarried coral stones and features intricate details on its facade. It includes a separate but equally remarkable Bacarra Bell Tower. Dedicated to St. Andrew the Apostle, the church remains a center of worship and spirituality for the local Catholic community. It serves as a symbol of Bacarra's history, the enduring influence of Spanish colonization, and is a popular tourist attraction, particularly during the annual Bac-Bacarra Festival, which features religious and cultural events around the church. Preservation efforts are in place to maintain its historical and architectural significance.

                        The Bacarra River originates from the Bislak RIver that flows from the spring water of the Cordilleras. The Bacarra River is the setting of the believed story about the origin of “Bacarra” as the townname. It was a fishing target of the nearby residents and non-poblacion residents.
